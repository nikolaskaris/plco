            The world, as I see it, is made up of systems. It is the result of an interconnected set of elements organized in a way that achieves an outcome. A tree is a system. A forest is a system. I am a system. Systems are often embedded in larger systems, which are embedded in yet larger systems. The earth’s climate is a system comprised of the subsystems of our atmosphere, oceans, land, and human society. Within the framework of systems thinking, outcomes represent the result of the interactions between various elements of a system. Systems contain within them the causes of their own failure and, importantly, their own success. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I work uniquely on problems that require systems thinking and thus have no single silver bullet solution. Rather than narrowly focusing on one approach, I take and teach a more holistic view of developing systemic solutions. At the core of my work is identifying and activating leverage points that can create significant, positive impact in climate change mitigation and energy transition for a wide range of stakeholders. These stakeholders include leading scientific institutions, governments, businesses, universities and foundations. Whether it be communities facing climate change who want to create replicable and sustainable models for others to follow, businesses that want to develop sustainable practices that leverage climate change to grow profits, or governments that want to implement energy policies congruent with the social and cultural values of their constituencies, I work across sectors to create communications frameworks that facilitate the development and deployment of symbiotic, systemic solutions to these challenges.
            <br>
            <br>
            To develop these frameworks, a wide range of disciplines, partners and stakeholders must be brought together. To bring these various stakeholders together, communications systems and frameworks need to be developed that tap into siloed intelligences, which when brought into symbiotic dialogue with each other, enable the generation of new outcomes congruent with a habitable future. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is the focus of my work, as an educator and researcher at the Yale School of Forestry, as director of the Yale Science Communications with Impact Network (SCWIN), and as a consultant with a broad network of global partners.

        Climate adaptation is an urgent priority for Least Developed Countries (LDCs), where climate risks magnify pressing development challenges. To catalyze action on adaptation, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process under the Cancun Adaptation Framework.  The NAP process starts with stocktaking: each country must establish a baseline of its existing vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity based on past climate data and future climate scenarios. However, the quality and quantity of country-specific climate data available to LDCs is limited. Many LDCs have insufficient in-country technical capacity to evaluate climate data, assess vulnerabilities, and appraise and implement adaptation initiatives.  These knowledge and capacity gaps impede the NAP process.      
        <br><br>
        S2A, a project of the Yale Science Communications with Impact Network (SCWIN), is a digital platform that will make available to policymakers and practitioners in LDCs the knowledge and services of scientists and experts affiliated with the IPCC, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and other global science networks.  By partnering with scientists who have interdisciplinary expertise, LDCs can develop their long-term national adaptation strategy, and enhance their capacity to implement adaptation initiatives.</p>

        <h2>Virgin Earth Challenge</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p>The IPCC states that to limit global warming to two degrees, carbon dioxide emissions must fall to zero between 2040 and 2070, falling “below zero” thereafter. To accomplish this, net zero emission frameworks need allow for limited continued carbon output, balanced by concomitant carbon drawdown supplied by CDR (carbon dioxide recovery) and/or GGR (greenhouse gas recovery) technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or “Bio-CCS”, and ecologically-based solutions, such as ecosystem restoration. CDR/GGR is unparalleled in its potential capacity to balance emissions with uptake, rather than halting emissions completely in a carbon-based world. The technology has a vital role to play in the climate endgame if we wish to target lower levels of CO2 in the atmosphere such as 350 ppm. 
        <br><br>
        However, the scalable application of CDR/GGR technologies remains unfeasible. Our understanding of CDR/GGR technologically, scientifically, and socially underdeveloped. There are no widely accepted frameworks with which to evaluate and integrate CDR potential; no scalable metrics to assess/measure/monitor CDR-induced carbon drawdown; and no viable economic models, business cases or policies sufficient to incentivize CDR implementation – especially among policymakers and entrepreneurs.
        <br><br>
        The Virgin Earth Challenge (Sir Richard Branson’s $25M innovation prize for scalable and sustainable ways of removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere), aims to build coalitions across business, policy, economics, science and civil society for a comprehensive strategy and path for the sensible advancement of a portfolio of carbon dioxide removal technologies, viable economic models, business cases or policies sufficient to incentivize interest in CDR/GGR technology implementation and deployment on the road to restoring the chemistry of the atmosphere and seas.</p>

        <h2>IPCC — Science to Business Global Platform</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        Commenced with the IPCC in early 2015, S2B (Science to Business) is a concept designed to continue the effort to create a digital platform connecting scientists with businesses, particularly around climate matters. S2B is an historic first, bringing together the world’s most celebrated and renowned business leaders with top influencers and scientists worldwide hailing from the world’s most prestigious institutions, universities and think tanks in the interest of innovating solutions and opportunities to crack the world’s most pressing environmental challenges related to our future by generating joint solutions. Additional collaborators will be the Secretariat to the Climate Convention and the Future Earth Network of the International Council of Science (ICSU). Participation is also expected from Yale Center for Business and the Environment, Yale School of Management, and Yale Forestry \& Environmental Sciences.
        <br><br>
        Efforts to make progress in the implementation of sustainable business development are increasingly being stalled by lack of scientific knowledge rather than environmental disregard for consequences: how can the decline in productivity for African agriculture be reversed while preserving biodiversity? How much greenhouse warming is too much? How can progress toward sustainability be reliably measured? How to define, measure and implement realistic science-based business targets?
        <br><br>
        S2B is a scalable digital platform for providing scientific resources and solutions to sustainability challenges on an ongoing and unlimited basis for global business leaders and groups.
        <br><br>
        The mission of S2B is to address the need for harnessing science and technology in support of efforts to achieve the goal of environmentally sustainable business development. Much of the discussion, to date, regarding sustainability, has been cast in terms of a contest between environmental protection and business development – often without fully examining whether that’s a true dichotomy.
        <br><br>
        The purpose of S2B is to recast business and scientific development as partners, not adversaries, and to introduce technology to enable interchanges between world-leading scientists and business leaders on an ongoing, scalable basis towards together addressing specific business challenges, opportunities and strategies in the changing world ahead.
        <br><br>
        The format of S2B is a digital framework, starting with a pilot developed by Yale Science Communications With Impact Network (SCWIN) and Me2U Media (a science communications firm pioneering expressive techniques for communication based on values-congruent, scientifically-correct approaches for business, policy, and civil society goals to help meet the environmental and sustainability challenges), working in cooperation with leading science academies worldwide (UK, USA, China, Latin America, India), and beginning with a focus on climate science and business in tandem with the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).
        <br><br>
        The pilot platform will be developed from September-May 2016, and launched live in Fall 2016. Yale University will host the multi-stakeholder discussions towards the foundation, architecture and strategic business plan for the S2B digital platform, which will offer and facilitate online working groups between business and science leaders towards specific business challenges on an ongoing basis. 
        <br><br>
        The expectation is that S2B partners (business leaders, Yale, IPCC, UNFCCC) will announce the project commencement at two prestigious international science and business events. After its crafting in colloquy at Yale University as part of the Yale Science Communications With Impact Network from September-December 2015, the S2B framework – as well as its overall strategy goals and launch alliances – will first be announced at the United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change 21 in December 2015. The second premiere of S2B, the world’s first and only global science-business convening and colloquy devoted to business solutions, will be held at Davos World Economic Forum in January 2016. S2B is projected to launch its beta version in Fall 2016.
        <br><br>
        The experience of S2B for business stakeholders, post beta, starts with an S2B subscription, for a month, three months, or a year. Subscribers log in to the S2B portal/app. All solutions work will be online-enabled: i.e., video- and telecommunications-powered.
        <br><br>
        Subscribers can then take advantage of the rich S2B network of scientists, researchers and experts who will be available for working group collaborations on an ongoing basis from the world’s leading science institutions and bodies. These resources, all the caliber of the IPCC, will span all science disciplines: climate, energy, social, political, economic, natural, atmospheric, biological and space. S2B also delivers individual informed experts, scientists, consultants, community leaders and researchers for on-the-ground, local and regional knowledge/input on command.  For a climate content project, for example, assigned experts might be a biologist, a geologist and a social scientist. In the case of a climate education project, stakeholders might include an environmental scientist, an educator, a communication scientist, and a business owner from the target region. All project workflows and output (production process solutions; campaigns; policy plans; best practices) will be monitored and measured for effectiveness with predetermined benchmarks, indices and metrics.
        <br><br>
        Exclusive subscriber workshops will be routinely hosted by S2B leaders in the communication field to help educate, facilitate and mediate communication across S2B’s diverse groups, with particular focus on improving communications between science and business leaders.
        <br><br>
        Along with producing special S2B subscriber peer-to-peer online workshops and events, S2B will also host public colloquies, debates, and webinars. These multiple cross-collaboration events will further climate science information for subscribers and the public, while addressing co-occurring specific social, environmental and industrial challenges for S2B subscribers.
        <br><br>
        With Me2U Media and Yale University, the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and WBCSD (World Business Council for Sustainable Development) are currently providing guidance and vision for the realization of the S2B digital communications platform, which will become the digital workspace for S2B business subscribers and affiliated scientists, experts and other partners. Funding for the early research stages of the project will be provided by Yale University, and for launch, seed funding will be raised.
        <br><br>
        While S2B is launching first with a focus on climate science and business, the plan is for S2B to create similar platforms for Science To Policy (S2P), Policy To Business (P2B) and to scale to a variety of cross-sector working groups engaging in multiple environmental challenges with scientists of multiple disciplines in 2016. Towards this end, discussions are now being held with the world’s leading science academies (AAAS, Beijing Academy, Royal Society, etc.) as well as international sustainability research organizations like Future Earth, ICSU (International Council of Scientific Unions), and other leading research think tanks.
        <br><br>
        S2B will not be limited to climate change and business, but will extend to support sustainability, transformation and energy systems reconstitution locally, regionally and globally. Toward building this capacity, the S2B team will commence development with several working groups and sub-groups to further the S2B digital platform build itself, as well as develop the S2B business model. Additional working groups will undertake actual research and development of the methods, means and resources used to pair corporate or NGO clients with science-based business solutions:

        S2B Working Group 1 – S2B digital platform/business model build
        <br><br>
        Other S2B test project-related working groups will be created to address environment-related business issues by connecting businesses to the appropriate scientists/experts. Then the methodologies, systems and resources used to address the challenges of these working groups will be recorded, mapped, categorized and studied for development of the S2B platform application. The following corporate entities and their challenges that are currently under consideration for development through use of S2B methodologies include:
        <br><br>
        S2B Working Group 2 – Monsanto: Low production issues of maize (corn) related to ongoing drought in areas of sub-Saharan Africa
        <br><br>
        S2B Working Group 3 – Apple, Inc.: Mitigation or avoidance of environmental damage and health issues related to hand-harvesting of components and materials built into electronic devices (phones; computers, etc.) for recycling
        <br><br>
        S2B Working Group 4 – Unilever: Find alternate source of edible oleaginous material to substitute for palm oil a for vast array of Unilever food and cosmetic products and applications
        <br><br>
        In summary, the aim of S2B is to generate a framework for business and science to work together to consciously manage a transition towards a long term sustainable symbiosis between humankind and the Earth system. The core value of S2B is to function as a science and business nexus, and present an opportunity to reconsider how science can be better harnessed to achieve business goals of sustainable development. The goal of S2B is to create a digital platform that will offer an opportunity for a range of organized, disciplined, reflective activities needed for intelligently and effectively guiding businesses through sustainability transitions.
        <br><br>
        The outcome of S2B is to provide sustainable business solutions that are not just driven by what business thinks it needs, or what science thinks it ought to do, but by solutions that allow both to come together to support business and planet in partnership. S2B aims to bring to scale a new contract for planetary stewardship between business and science, and the means to produce results. S2B business members will enjoy an unprecedented opportunity to develop science-based dialogue and collaboration to help crack business challenges relevant to sustainability, leading environmental practice and the stewardship of the planet earth.

        <p><a href="http://daily.jstor.org">JSTOR Daily</a> is an online magazine and newsletter published by JSTOR, a not-for-profit digital library of scholarly journals, books, policy reports, and primary source materials. JSTOR Daily had over 1.6 million readers last year, and over 200k people receive an email digest of stories each week. The site publishes editorial stories on a wide range of subjects highlighting the peer-reviewed and other material available via the JSTOR library.
        Later this year, JSTOR Daily will launch a Sustainability news vertical that draws on the scholarly and policy literature hosted in JSTOR. In the proposed partnership, students will have the opportunity to develop an editorial and content distribution plan for a sustainability news site intended to broaden the reach and impact of sustainability scholarship, with special attention to (1) building an editorial apparatus and community of experts who can ‘translate’ academic literature effectively for a non-academic audience and (2) developing an outreach plan to support the dissemination of this news vertical. The final deliverables would be an editorial and outreach plan, ideally with indications of a group of experts who could help to shape the academic research in JSTOR into more conversational, general-interest pieces.</p>
