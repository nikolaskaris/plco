            The world, as I see it, is made up of systems: it is the result of an interconnected set of elements organized in a way that produces outcomes. A tree is a system. A forest is a system. I am a system. Systems are often embedded in larger systems, which are embedded in yet larger systems. The earth’s climate is a system comprised of the subsystems of our atmosphere, oceans, land, and human society. Systems contain within them the causes of their own failure and, importantly, their own success. 
            <br><br>
            Much like an indeterministic system, my academic and professional careers have spanned disciplines, sectors and practices. I spent more than two decades working as a writer, director, and executive producer for media companies including Fox, CNN, Time Warner, and the Discovery Channel. I’ve founded two companies: Citizen Global, which built globally scalable video and research sharing for science collaborations with stakeholders in media, politics, military and law enforcement; and Me2U Media, a communications platform that worked with clients to develop systems-based frameworks for the creation of new information ecosystems with an emphasis on sustainability and earth science communications for public policy messaging. Today, I split my time as an independent consultant for a wide range of clients, institutes and governments, including the IPCC, World Meteorological Organization, and the National Council on Science and the Environment, and at Yale, where I’m a lecturer at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Science and Director of the Yale Science Communications with Impact Network (SCWIN).  
            <br><br>
            I work uniquely on problems that require systems thinking and thus have no single silver bullet solution. At the core of my work is identifying and activating leverage points that can create significant, positive impact in climate change mitigation and energy transition for a wide range of stakeholders. These stakeholders include leading scientific institutions, governments, businesses, universities and foundations. Whether it be communities facing climate change who want to create replicable and sustainable models for others to follow, businesses that want to develop sustainable practices that leverage climate change to grow profits, or governments that want to implement energy policies congruent with the social and cultural values of their constituencies, I work across sectors to create humanistic communications frameworks that facilitate the development and deployment of symbiotic, systemic solutions to these challenges. By merging siloed intelligences into a dynamic, symbiotic whole, new outcomes can be generated that are congruent with a habitable future.

      <div class="row">
        <p>
        Climate adaptation is an urgent priority for Least Developed Countries (LDCs), where climate risks magnify pressing development challenges. To catalyze action on adaptation, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process under the Cancun Adaptation Framework.  The NAP process starts with stocktaking: each country must establish a baseline of its existing vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity based on past climate data and future climate scenarios. However, the quality and quantity of country-specific climate data available to LDCs is limited. Many LDCs have insufficient in-country technical capacity to evaluate climate data, assess vulnerabilities, and appraise and implement adaptation initiatives.  These knowledge and capacity gaps impede the NAP process.      
        <br><br>
        S2A, a project of the Yale Science Communications with Impact Network (SCWIN), is a digital platform that will make available to policymakers and practitioners in LDCs the knowledge and services of scientists and experts affiliated with the IPCC, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and other global science networks.  By partnering with scientists who have interdisciplinary expertise, LDCs can develop their long-term national adaptation strategy, and enhance their capacity to implement adaptation initiatives.</p>

        <h2>Virgin Earth Challenge</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p>The IPCC states that to limit global warming to two degrees, carbon dioxide emissions must fall to zero between 2040 and 2070, falling “below zero” thereafter. To accomplish this, net zero emission frameworks need allow for limited continued carbon output, balanced by concomitant carbon drawdown supplied by CDR (carbon dioxide recovery) and/or GGR (greenhouse gas recovery) technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or “Bio-CCS”, and ecologically-based solutions, such as ecosystem restoration. CDR/GGR is unparalleled in its potential capacity to balance emissions with uptake, rather than halting emissions completely in a carbon-based world. The technology has a vital role to play in the climate endgame if we wish to target lower levels of CO2 in the atmosphere such as 350 ppm. 
        <br><br>
        However, the scalable application of CDR/GGR technologies remains unfeasible. Our understanding of CDR/GGR technologically, scientifically, and socially underdeveloped. There are no widely accepted frameworks with which to evaluate and integrate CDR potential; no scalable metrics to assess/measure/monitor CDR-induced carbon drawdown; and no viable economic models, business cases or policies sufficient to incentivize CDR implementation – especially among policymakers and entrepreneurs.
        <br><br>
        The <a href="http://www.virginearth.com/">Virgin Earth Challenge</a> (Sir Richard Branson’s $25M innovation prize for scalable and sustainable ways of removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere), aims to build coalitions across business, policy, economics, science and civil society for a comprehensive strategy and path for the sensible advancement of a portfolio of carbon dioxide removal technologies, viable economic models, business cases or policies sufficient to incentivize interest in CDR/GGR technology implementation and deployment on the road to restoring the chemistry of the atmosphere and seas.</p>

        <h2>IPCC — Science to Business Global Platform</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p>Efforts to make progress in the implementation of sustainable business development are increasingly being stalled by lack of scientific knowledge rather than by disregard for environmental consequences. How can the decline in productivity for African agriculture be reversed while preserving biodiversity? How much greenhouse warming is too much? How can progress toward sustainability be reliably measured? How to define, measure and implement realistic science-based business targets?
        <br><br>
        Commenced with the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">IPCC</a> in early 2015, S2B (Science to Business) is a concept designed to create a digital platform connecting scientists with businesses, particularly around climate matters. S2B is an historic first, bringing together the world’s most celebrated and renowned business leaders with top influencers and scientists hailing from the world’s most prestigious institutions, universities and think tanks in the interest of innovating solutions and opportunities to crack the world’s most pressing environmental challenges. 
        <br><br>
        S2B is a scalable digital platform for providing scientific resources and solutions to sustainability challenges for global business leaders, using pioneering expressive techniques for communication based on values-congruent, scientifically-correct approaches to business. The mission of S2B is to address the need to harness science and technology in support of efforts to achieve the goal of environmentally sustainable business development. Much of the discussion, to date, regarding sustainability, has been cast in terms of a contest between environmental protection and business development – often without fully examining whether that’s a true dichotomy. Through S2B, business and science are recast as partners, not adversaries. 
        <br><br>
        The aim of S2B is to generate a framework for business and science to work together to consciously manage a transition towards a long term sustainable symbiosis between humankind and the Earth system. The outcome of S2B is to provide sustainable business solutions that are not just driven by what business thinks it needs, or what science thinks it ought to do, but by solutions that allow both to come together to support business and planet in partnership.</p>

        Later this year, JSTOR Daily will launch a Sustainability news vertical that draws on the policy literature hosted by JSTOR. In the proposed partnership, students will have the opportunity to develop an editorial and content distribution plan for a sustainability news site intended to broaden the reach and impact of sustainability scholarship, with special attention to (1) building an editorial apparatus and community of experts who can ‘translate’ academic literature effectively for a non-academic audience and (2) developing an outreach plan to support the dissemination of this news vertical.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <p>A coherent strategy and a compelling strategic narrative are essential to closing the action gap on climate change. Despite the extensive scientific evidence of climate change, there is a significant gap between what actions scientists say are necessary to prevent catastrophic climate change, and the limited efforts that are currently happening globally to address them, the so-called ‘action gap’. In partnership with the <a href="http://www.gdpc.org/">Greater Dallas Planning Council</a>, Yale students and SCWIN fellows will help develop, deploy and pilot a coalition-building public communication strategy to support public policy and business sector engagement in sustainable development for the region, both independently and in partnership with Yale and various external entities. They will also identify what we need to attract in order to leverage sustainable development in this region by identifying Federal, State and local funding sources. This framework will be replicable in other parts of Dallas and the US.</p>
