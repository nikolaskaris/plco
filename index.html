            PAUL LUSSIER is a Yale alum, graduating Cum Laude in the class of 1982. Since 2013, he has been teaching courses at Yale that he originated: "Towards Science Communications With Impact: Environmental Engagement for a Changing World" at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Sciences, and "Environmental Communications for Public Policy" at Yale College.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lussier is the Founder and Director of the Yale Science Communications with Impact Network (SCWIN) for the development, piloting and deployment of coalition-building public communication strategies, public policy, and business sector engagement with planetary science, both independently and in partnership with Yale and various external entities.
            <br>
            <br>
            Current and past SCWIN research partners include government entities in the United States and elsewhere, including the City of New Haven, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research, the Saudi Arabian Energy Ministry, the Chinese Science and Technology Ministry, and the governments of the nations of the United Kingdom and Mozambique. Lussier and SCWIN have also assisted leading global science institutions including the United Nations Stakeholder Forum, and the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). 
            <br>
            <br>
            Lussier and SCWIN, on behalf of Yale, are Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) observers. Lussier is also among those working  informally on communications with the IPCC. Lussier was invited to the IPCC Expert Meeting on Communications the following February, 2016, and made a presentation on behalf of SCWIN on sector-based communications, which was included in the event's official Meeting Report. In 2016, Lussier was also designated as Executive Director, Climate Communications, to the National Council on Science and Environment (NCSE) after delivering the keynote address at the 2016 National Conference and Global Forum on Science, Policy and the Environment, in Washington, DC. In 2016, Lussier was also engaged as an official Consultant to the Independent Committee on Climate Change, for the government of the United Kingdom.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lussier is partnered with the National Council on Science and Environment (NCSE) in the development of the Climate Communications Corps, a college- and university-based network.
            <br>
            <br>
            SCWIN also assists corporations, brands and organizations with programs to focus and deepen their engagement in environmental issues by developing communication strategies and campaigns that provide traction in sustainability by integrating real ecological and technological solutions towards climate change and related planetary boundaries challenges.

            <br>
            Lussier is currently working on his latest book, <i>DOMINION: Solutions to Change Our World</i>, to be published by Knopf Doubleday in 22 countries in 2018. This non-fiction work tracks a science-based path from the present to sustainability by 2050.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lussier is also the Founder and former President/Executive Producer of Me2U Media, Inc., a business/education collaborative of experts in media, science, technology and communications established since 2012. Me2U Media provides the business and public policy sectors with science-based research for development and piloting of new information ecosystems, media planning solutions and brand messaging, with specific emphasis on sustainability and earth science communications. Me2U Media leverages all available platforms, technologies and entertainment genres, in all formats: print, digital, broadcast and live events. Ownership of Me2U MEdia was transferred in 2017.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before founding Me2U Media, Lussier was the Founder/President/CEO/Executive Producer/Writer for Citizen Global, founded for the invention of online collaborative video-enabled working groups for education and content-sharing purposes. Lussier developed and acquired patents for globally scalable video-enabled lesson plans and research sharing for science collaborations with media and citizen, cultural, political, military and law enforcement stakeholders. Partners included LEEDER (US Law Enforcement), CIA, Fox Broadcasting, Univision, PRISA Spain and Latin America, BBC Education, X-Prize, National Geographic, Oprah Winfrey, CNN, Starbucks, 350.org, and Fremantle Media.
            <br>
            <br>
            For two decades, Lussier was an Executive Producer/Writer for Time-Warner Television, A&ampE, Discovery Channel, National Geographic, HBO, ABC, CBS, Fox and other major global communication outlets. He has supervised, written and/or produced over 200 hours of media across all areas of news and entertainment.

        <p>
        Climate adaptation is an urgent priority for Least Developed Countries (LDCs), where climate risks magnify pressing development challenges. To catalyze action on adaptation, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process under the Cancun Adaptation Framework.  The NAP process starts with stocktaking: each country must establish a baseline of its existing vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity based on past climate data and future climate scenarios. However, the quality and quantity of country-specific climate data available to LDCs is limited. Many LDCs have insufficient in-country technical capacity to evaluate climate data, assess vulnerabilities, and appraise and implement adaptation initiatives.  These knowledge and capacity gaps impede the NAP process.      
        <br><br>
        S2A, a project of the Yale Science Communications with Impact Network (SCWIN), is a digital platform that will make available to policymakers and practitioners in LDCs the knowledge and services of scientists and experts affiliated with the IPCC, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and other global science networks.  By partnering with scientists who have interdisciplinary expertise, LDCs can develop their long-term national adaptation strategy, and enhance their capacity to implement adaptation initiatives.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <p>The IPCC states that to limit global warming to two degrees, carbon dioxide emissions must fall to zero between 2040 and 2070, falling “below zero” thereafter. To accomplish this, net zero emission frameworks need allow for limited continued carbon output, balanced by concomitant carbon drawdown supplied by CDR (carbon dioxide recovery) and/or GGR (greenhouse gas recovery) technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or “Bio-CCS”, and ecologically-based solutions, such as ecosystem restoration. CDR/GGR is unparalleled in its potential capacity to balance emissions with uptake, rather than halting emissions completely in a carbon-based world. The technology has a vital role to play in the climate endgame if we wish to target lower levels of CO2 in the atmosphere such as 350 ppm. 
        <br><br>
        However, the scalable application of CDR/GGR technologies remains unfeasible. Our understanding of CDR/GGR technologically, scientifically, and socially underdeveloped. There are no widely accepted frameworks with which to evaluate and integrate CDR potential; no scalable metrics to assess/measure/monitor CDR-induced carbon drawdown; and no viable economic models, business cases or policies sufficient to incentivize CDR implementation – especially among policymakers and entrepreneurs.
        <br><br>
        The <a href="http://www.virginearth.com/">Virgin Earth Challenge</a> (Sir Richard Branson’s $25M innovation prize for scalable and sustainable ways of removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere), aims to build coalitions across business, policy, economics, science and civil society for a comprehensive strategy and path for the sensible advancement of a portfolio of carbon dioxide removal technologies, viable economic models, business cases or policies sufficient to incentivize interest in CDR/GGR technology implementation and deployment on the road to restoring the chemistry of the atmosphere and seas.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <p>Efforts to make progress in the implementation of sustainable business development are increasingly being stalled by lack of scientific knowledge rather than by disregard for environmental consequences. How can the decline in productivity for African agriculture be reversed while preserving biodiversity? How much greenhouse warming is too much? How can progress toward sustainability be reliably measured? How to define, measure and implement realistic science-based business targets?
        <br><br>
        Commenced with the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">IPCC</a> in early 2015, S2B (Science to Business) is a concept designed to create a digital platform connecting scientists with businesses, particularly around climate matters. S2B is an historic first, bringing together the world’s most celebrated and renowned business leaders with top influencers and scientists hailing from the world’s most prestigious institutions, universities and think tanks in the interest of innovating solutions and opportunities to crack the world’s most pressing environmental challenges. 
        <br><br>
        S2B is a scalable digital platform for providing scientific resources and solutions to sustainability challenges for global business leaders, using pioneering expressive techniques for communication based on values-congruent, scientifically-correct approaches to business. The mission of S2B is to address the need to harness science and technology in support of efforts to achieve the goal of environmentally sustainable business development. Much of the discussion, to date, regarding sustainability, has been cast in terms of a contest between environmental protection and business development – often without fully examining whether that’s a true dichotomy. Through S2B, business and science are recast as partners, not adversaries. 
        <br><br>
        The aim of S2B is to generate a framework for business and science to work together to consciously manage a transition towards a long term sustainable symbiosis between humankind and the Earth system. The outcome of S2B is to provide sustainable business solutions that are not just driven by what business thinks it needs, or what science thinks it ought to do, but by solutions that allow both to come together to support business and planet in partnership.</p>

        <p><a href="http://daily.jstor.org">JSTOR Daily</a> is an online magazine and newsletter published by JSTOR, a not-for-profit digital library of scholarly journals, books, policy reports, and primary source materials. JSTOR Daily had over 1.6 million readers last year, and over 200k subscribers to their weekly email digest. The site publishes editorial stories on a wide range of subjects highlighting the 
        material available via the JSTOR library.
        <br><br>
        Later this year, JSTOR Daily will launch a Sustainability news vertical that draws on the policy literature hosted by JSTOR. In the proposed partnership, students will have the opportunity to develop an editorial and content distribution plan for a sustainability news site intended to broaden the reach and impact of sustainability scholarship, with special attention to (1) building an editorial apparatus and community of experts who can ‘translate’ academic literature effectively for a non-academic audience and (2) developing an outreach plan to support the dissemination of this news vertical.</p>

        <h2>South Dallas Redevelopment Sustainability Framework</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p>A coherent strategy and a compelling strategic narrative are essential to closing the action gap on climate change. Despite the extensive scientific evidence of climate change, there is a significant gap between what actions scientists say are necessary to prevent catastrophic climate change, and the limited efforts that are currently happening globally to address them, the so-called ‘action gap’. In partnership with the <a href="http://www.gdpc.org/">Greater Dallas Planning Council</a>, Yale students and SCWIN fellows will help develop, deploy and pilot a coalition-building public communication strategy to support public policy and business sector engagement in sustainable development for the region, both independently and in partnership with Yale and various external entities. They will also identify what we need to attract in order to leverage sustainable development in this region by identifying Federal, State and local funding sources. This framework will be replicable in other parts of Dallas and the US.</p>

        <p>The mission of the Collective Intelligence Network to Save the Oceans (CINSO) is to map the world’s ocean space to identify paramount anthropogenic stressors and develop humanistic network based solutions to environmental degradation. Students will have the opportunity to establish nodes of engagement and develop new ocean narratives by mapping the strengths and weaknesses of major global ocean efforts to date. With support from <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a>, students will address knowledge and capacity gaps, set objectives, pinpoint metrics of success and reframe the issues to develop diversified and targeted narratives. </p>
